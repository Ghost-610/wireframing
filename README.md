# wireframing

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the design process for websites and applications. It's essentially creating a visual blueprint or skeletal framework of a digital product, focusing on its structure, layout, and functionality, rather than its visual aesthetics (like colors, fonts, or imagery).

# Key Elements of a Wireframe:

- Layout and Structure: How content is organized on the screen, including the placement of key elements.

- Navigation: How users will move between different pages or sections of the product (e.g., menus, links, tabs).

- Content Hierarchy: Prioritizing the most important content and guiding the user's attention.

- Functionality: Showing interactive elements like buttons, forms, and search bars, without detailing their final visual design.

- Annotations (optional but helpful): Notes that explain the purpose, behavior, or rationale behind certain design decisions.

# Types of Wireframes

- Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.

* Early Brainstorming and Ideation: When you're just starting a project and exploring many different ideas quickly. Lo-fi wireframes allow for rapid sketching and discarding of concepts.

- High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

* Later Stages of Design: After the core structure and user flows have been validated with low-fidelity wireframes.
